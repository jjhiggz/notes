I met her the same, place I drank to escape
Wasted because I thought I was a waste
But she never saw what I saw in myself
maybe loves blind, but I’ll give it hell

It wasn’t long before she owned my heart
But she don’t want nothing if she don’t take part
she said How could you love me if I don’t love back
I thought for a second and than I said that

Baby Life is short
Death is kind
But A piece of you
Gives me peace of mind
I Fell in love and I can’t just fall out
I’m just lucky I’m alive

She’s on my mind, I’m walking back home
Thinking about all the curves life likes to throw
It’s colder than hell but I’m actually warm
It’s rare that I find someone I could call home

He don’t got nothing and he never did
Raised like an animal he’s just a kid
He came from the back with a gun to my side
Did what he had to to stay alive

He said
Life is short
Death is kind
But a piece of yours
Gives me peace of mind

Empty your pockets
And shut your mouth
You’re just lucky you’re alive

[And he was right]

She never knew that she’d love me at all
That her and my life would turn into ours
I told her I’d love her to death
Now love ain’t blind but it’s reached the end

and I don’t wanna die in a hospital bed
I’d rather go skydive and land on my head
But if she’s by my side I still wanna live
There’s just one last something that I want to give

Baby Life is short
Death ain’t been kind
But a piece of you
gave me peace of
mind

As long as you’re here when I die
I’m lucky I’m alive

Life is short
But while I’m alive
A piece of you
Gives me peace of mind

And after I’m gone
Don’t lose your mind
Cuz you’re lucky you’re alive”
