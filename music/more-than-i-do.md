# More Than I Do

## Verse 1

I love creating
Was born with no patience
Everyone hated
until I became me

used to feel jaded,
used to get faded,
I had no basis,
till you set me free

## Chorus

You know me, more than I do
I know more of you than you

I know we’ve tried and it’s true
Baby I love you

## Verse 2

I love the way that
She loves when I say that

When we do nothing
I actually feel

Like there is nothing
Where used to be something

Outta my brain
and Into the real

If my pockets were empty,
And everyone left me,

I know she'd be with me
out in the street

Home's where your heart is
My hearts always with her
And when she's not here I still carry with me

## Chorus

You know me, more than I do
I know more of you than you

I know we’ve tried and it’s true
Baby I love you
